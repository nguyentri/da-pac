It can be modified either by the Sensor Node\'s core (by executing an \"RDCBI\" command) or by the Sensor Node\'s microcode, when the latter directly modifies the specific bit-field of SNC_STATUS_REG.\nWhen the Sensor Node\'s FSM is in its initial state (which may happen either by switching-on the PD_COM power domain or by resetting the Sensor Node via SNC_CTRL_REG.SNC_RESET), the specific bit-field is kept to \'0\', for initialization purposes.\nWhen the Sensor Node is stopped and then reset, the Sensor Node\'s FSM is not in its initial state and in that case, the EQ_FLAG bit-field should be reset by the user (if the application needs this to be initialized to \'0\'). Otherwise, it can be left as it is, until being updated by the Sensor Node itself (upon executing an \"RDCBI\" command).\nIn general, however, this bit-field should not be modified by either the host processor (CM33) or the CMAC processor (CM0+), and especially when the Sensor Node is enabled and operational."]
